= VisibilityChecker

VisibilityChecker exposes a single method, visibility_changes, for returning
an array with places where any ancestor of the given class/module has changed the
visibility of any of the methods classes/modules methods.

= Installation

= Usage

Here's an example showing normal use:

  require 'visibility_checker'

  class C
    def a
    end
  end

  VisibilityChecker.visibility_changes(C)
  # => []

  module M
    def a
    end
  end
  C.include M

  VisibilityChecker.visibility_changes(C)
  # => []

  class C
    private :a
  end

  VisibilityChecker.visibility_changes(C)
  #  => [#<struct VisibilityChecker::VisibilityChange 
  #        method=:a, defined_in=M, original_visibility=:public,
  #        overridden_by=C, new_visibility=:private>]

You can also extend classes or modules with +VisibilityChecker+
and call +visibility_changes+ on them:

  C.extend VisibilityChecker
  C.visibility_changes
  # => [#<struct VisibilityChecker::VisibilityChange ... >]

Or if you want to add the +visibility_changes+ method to all
classes and modules, have +Module+ include it:

  Module.include VisibilityChecker
  M.visibility_changes
  # => []

+VisibilityChecker.visibility_changes+ accepts two keyword arguments:

stop_at :: The ancestor at which to stop for visibility changes, Object
           by default.
skip_owners :: Skip reporting a visibility change if the method that
               was overridden was defined in this module/class.  Set to
               Kernel by default as general Ruby practice is that Kernel
               methods can be overridden (e.g. Enumerable#select).
